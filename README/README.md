# Layer Programming Language

Layer is a new programming language designed to be fast and the most powerful programming language. What makes Layer different from other programming languages is its completely new and different execution architecture.

## Layer Working and Execution Architecture

Layer does not use the traditional interpreter or compiler architecture, it uses a new architecture called the 'layer engine'. The layer code can be written in a text editor and saved with the '.layer' or '.ly' extension. The layer engine is a program that reads the layer code and executes it.

The layer engine performs the following steps:

1. Lexical analysis
2. Syntax analysis
3. Semantic analysis
4. Code generation
5. Code execution

The layer engine generates a 'super prompt' based on layer code. The super prompt is a new type of LLM prompt which can only be understood by the layer LLM. The layer LLM, what we call it 'Assembly fusion', is a new type of LLM which is trained only on Assembly language, X86, X86_64, ARM architectures. It is trained to understand the super prompts generated by the layer engine. And based on the super prompt, the layer LLM generates the ASM code. Then, the ASM code is what the layer engine executes, making it the fastest programming language.

## Layer Language Design

Layer language has several components such as comments, indentation, newline, whitespace, identifiers, numbers, strings, operators, keywords, punctuation, boolean, statements, variable declaration and initialization, print statement, loops, and conditional statements.

For more details, please refer to the `main.py` file.

## Getting Started

To get started with Layer, clone the repository and navigate to the `LayerProject` directory. From there, you can start implementing the functionality of each component in their respective files.
