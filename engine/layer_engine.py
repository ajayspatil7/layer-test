"""
The `layer_engine` and `super_prompt` are two main components of the Layer programming language's execution architecture. Here's a brief overview of what functionalities each of them should have:

1. `layer_engine`:
   - `Lexical Analysis`: This functionality should be able to read the Layer code and convert it into tokens.
   - `Syntax Analysis`: This functionality should be able to check the tokens for syntactical correctness.
   - `Semantic Analysis`: This functionality should be able to check the tokens for semantic correctness.
   - `Code Generation`: This functionality should be able to generate the 'super prompt' based on the Layer code.
   - `Code Execution`: This functionality should be able to execute the ASM code generated by the Layer LLM.

```
class LayerEngine:
    def lexical_analysis(self, code):
        # Convert the code into tokens
        pass

    def syntax_analysis(self, tokens):
        # Check the tokens for syntactical correctness
        pass

    def semantic_analysis(self, tokens):
        # Check the tokens for semantic correctness
        pass

    def code_generation(self, tokens):
        # Generate the 'super prompt' based on the Layer code
        pass

    def code_execution(self, asm_code):
        # Execute the ASM code generated by the Layer LLM
        pass
